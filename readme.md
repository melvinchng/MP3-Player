# RGB MP3 Player with Game

This repository contains the source code of an MP3 Player running on LPC 1768. The core source code are provided while the device drivers are removed. This is a two weeks long academic project. Minimal modifications may be required as the original code is written for RTOS (Real-time operating system) and the optimization has been removed in the source code. As noticed, the source code will not work by default.
